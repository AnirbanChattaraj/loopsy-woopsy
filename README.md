🎉 Pyramid Party 🏰✨

Welcome to my Loop Magic Playground where pyramids rise, flip, and dance with just a few lines of C code! 🚀

🎭 What’s Inside?

🌟 Full Star Pyramid → Classic triangle of stars.

🌪️ Inverted Full Star Pyramid → Same thing, flipped upside down.

🔢 Number Full Pyramid → Numbers climbing up like a staircase to the sky.

🔄 Inverted Number Full Pyramid → Numbers sliding back down.

🎯 Centered Number Pyramid → Numbers perfectly aligned in the middle (loop gymnastics 🏋️).
🧠 Why This Repo Exists

Because loops shouldn’t be boring!
Here you’ll:

Train your brain with nested loop kung fu 🥋

Learn the art of spacing (a.k.a. pyramid alignment zen 🧘)

Level up from basic baby patterns → to intermediate boss mode
🚀 What’s Next?

This party is just starting... coming soon:

Hollow pyramids (skeleton mode 💀)

Diamonds (bling bling 💎)

Hourglasses (time machine ⏳)

Palindromic pyramids (mirror magic 🪞)

💡 Got a wacky pattern idea? Drop it in — let’s keep the pyramid rave going! 🎶🔥
